# ChronoShift
HackDay Game Developing Project. I hace expanded on the given phrase "Oh, I already knew this".
ChronoShift is a high-octane precision platformer built with Next.js and Framer Motion. In this game, 'dying' is only the beginning. Every time you restart a level, a Temporal Shadow of your previous run is born, retracing your exact movements from the past. To succeed, you must navigate complex ruins and phase-shift through walls—all while avoiding a collision with your past self. It’s a race against time, where the only way to move forward is to outrun where you've already been.

Well, you already know what moves have you played you just have to get better avoid the same path and reach before your own shadow!
